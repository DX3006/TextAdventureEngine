# Text Adventure Engine

>The idea of this tool is to create a platform where users can create simple text-based games without even using a programming line
>
> After completing the game, you can easily distribute just by sending the game url, thus facilitating the distribution of games created on the platform

 
# How to use
> Go to the [editor page](https://dx3006.github.io/TextAdventureEngine/create/) and start creating your game.
>
> This tool is based on scenes, each scene can have buttons and these buttons lead to other scenes. This way you can create interactive stories with multiple paths to follow
>
> When you want to test or are you satisfied with your game just click on **Export**, you will be redirected to the game page. The generated link contains all the game information, thus facilitating the distribution of the same.
>
> If you want to send your game to someone, I strongly suggest you use a link shortener, as the urls generated by this engine are relatively big
>
> **[Working progress]**
>
> ~~if it's your first time opening the tool, a base project will be presented so you can learn the basics of creating games on this platform.~~
>
> ~~you can also try this same game running on the engine by clicking on this link~~
